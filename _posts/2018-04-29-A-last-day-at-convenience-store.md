I have worked at Ministop which is convenience store near my home since two month ago.

And today was a last day there.

So I wanted to show Farid who is my foreigner friend my part-time job before I don't work there.

He was willing come for me here.

So I was very happy.

And I showed him the convenience store.

Meanwhile, a customer come in here.

He is 56 age.

Also he spoke unskilled english to us although he is korean.

We heared his talk and communicated with him. 

He liked us, so he give tips which are included 30,000Won, icecreams and beverages.

We bought two 설렁탕 to eat by spending that money after I had finished work.

These seemed gift for my last work day.

Today was glad, happy and luck. haha
